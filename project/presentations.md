## Recommended outline for your talk (~1 minute per slide):

1. Title Slide: Who are you, title, date
2. Intro 1: Whats the big idea???
3. Intro 2: More specifically, what are you trying to learn?
4. Methods 1: What did you try?
5. Methods 2: What is the key idea?
6. Data 1: What data are you looking at?
7. Data 2: Anything notable about the data?
8. Results 1: What did you see!
9. Results 2: Does it work?
10. Results 3: How does it compare to other methods/data/ideas?
11. Discussion 1: What did you learn from this study?
12. Discussion 2: What does this mean for the future?
13. Acknowledgements: Who helped you along the way?
14. Thank you!

I strongly *discourage* you from trying to give a live demo as they are too unpredictable for a short talk. If you have running software you want to show, use a "cooking show" approach, where you have screen shots of the important steps.
