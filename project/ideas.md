# Project Ideas

Here are a few selected projects organized by theme, although you are also free to present your own project ideas. A good project is one that:
 
  1. Has a well defined goal
  2. Has a well defined method proposed for solving it; and 
  3. Has appropriate data and resources available. 
 
If any of these are not available, your project will not be successful, especially in the limited time remaining for class. A successful model for the class project is to apply a technique developed in a different context to the biological problem of your choice. Another successful model is to identify an important paper of interest and then try to improve apon their method in some way (faster, less memory, more sensitive, more precise, novel species, novel data sets, etc).

## Or your own idea! 

This should be more than you are already doing for your PhD work, but can be a novel twist to a dataset/idea you are already using. If you have a research idea but not the right data, let me know and I'll help you find some.
