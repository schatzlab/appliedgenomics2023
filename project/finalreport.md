Due Date: Sunday, December 17, 2023 @ 11:59pm 

Each team should submit a PDF of your final project proposal (6 to 9 pages) to GradeScope by 11:59pm on Sunday December 17. No late days can be used as grades must be submitted to the registrar that week.

The report should have at least:

* Title of your project
* List of team members and email addresses
* 1-2 paragraph abstract summarizing the project
* 1-2 pages of Introduction: Background, what is the big problem/question you are addressing, overview of data used, summary of results
* 2-3 pages of Methods that you are using: if you are primarily using existing methods, please describe those methods
* 2-3 pages of Results: be sure to describe the data evaluated along with the results of your analysis. If computational time is measured, please list the machine specifications
* 1 page of Discussion: what you have seen or how that relates to other papers
* Please include 4-6 main figures showing your results. If you have more figures, please include them in a supplemental figures section at the end of the PDF.
* 1 paragraph of acknowledgements
* 1/2 to 1 page of references to relevant papers and data

The report should use the Bioinformatics style template. Word and LaTeX templates are available at https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/pages/submission_online. You can (and should) expand on your preliminary report into the full report.

Please use Piazza if you have any questions!
