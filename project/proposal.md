## Project Proposal
Assignment Date: Wednesday October 11, 2023 <br>
Due Date: Wednesday, October 18 2023 @ 11:59pm <br>

Review the [Project Ideas](ideas.md) page

Work solo or form a team for your class project of no more than 3 people.

The proposal should have the following components:

  * Name of your team
  * List of team members and email addresses
  * Short title for your proposal
  * 1 paragraph description of what you hope to do and how you will do it
  * References to 2 to 3 relevant papers
  * References/URLs to datasets that you will be studying (Note you can also use simulated data)
  * Please add a note if you need me to sponsor you for a MARCC account (high RAM, GPUs, many cores, etc)
  * Please add a note if you need me to sponsor you for an AnVIL cloud billing account (dynamic resources)

Submit the proposal as a 1 to 2 page PDF on GradeScope (each team should submit one proposal and tag all people in the team). After submitting your proposal, I will provide feedback. If necessary, we can schedule a time to discuss your proposal, especially to ensure you have access to the data that you need. The sooner that you submit your proposal, the sooner we can schedule the meeting. 

Later, you will present your project in class during the last week of class. You will also submit a written report (5-7 pages) of your project, formatting as a Bioinformatics article (Intro, Methods, Results, Discussion, References). Word and LaTeX templates are 
available at [https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/pages/submission_online](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/pages/submission_online)

Please use Piazza to coordinate proposal plans!
