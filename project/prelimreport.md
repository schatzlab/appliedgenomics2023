The preliminary report should use the Bioinformatics style template. Word and LaTeX templates are available at [https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/pages/submission_online](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/pages/submission_online). [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) is recommended for LaTex submissions. [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com/) is recommended for non-latex submissions, especially group projects.
